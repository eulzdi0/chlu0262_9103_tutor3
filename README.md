Part1 ï¼šImaging Technique Inspiration-
The two images I looked for were overlapping colored beams created by refracting or reflecting surfaces. I was inspired by this imaging technique because it combines dynamic light behavior with spatial composition to create a layered and immersive experience. And different colors can be created by different angles of light, forming a dynamic work. What fascinates me most is how simple white light transforms into vibrant spectral colors through precise angular manipulation a natural prism effect where light direction determines hue.

Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration-
The blendMode(ADD) function in p5.js can simulate how multiple semi-transparent colors combine to create brighter hues. This is particularly effective when combined with the WebGL refraction shader in p5.js. This allows for a custom fragment shader that simulates the bending and scattering of light, as if it were passing through glass or crystal. This combination allows for realistic, immersive compositions that respond dynamically based on motion, lighting, or user interaction.
